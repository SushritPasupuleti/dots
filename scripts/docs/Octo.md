# Help for Octo.nvim

Allows using GH CLI to create and manage issues and PRs from within Neovim.

## üöÄ Usage

Just edit the issue title, body or comments as a regular buffer and use `:w(rite)` to sync the issue with GitHub.

## ü§ñ Commands

There is only an `Octo <object> <action> [arguments]` command:

## üìã PR review

- Open the PR (eg: `Octo <PR url>` or `Octo pr list` or `Octo pr edit <PR number>`)
- Start a review with `Octo review start` or resume a pending review with `Octo review resume`
- A new tab will show a panel with changed files and two windows showing the diff on any of them.
- Change panel entries with `]q` and `[q` or by selecting an entry in the window
- Add comments with `<space>ca` or suggestions with `<space>sa` on single or multiple visual-selected lines
  - A new buffer will appear in the alternate diff window. The cursor will be positioned in the new buffer
  - When ready, save the buffer to commit changes to GitHub
  - Move back to the diff window and move the cursor, the thread buffer will hide
- Hold the cursor on a line with a comment to show a thread buffer with all the thread comments
  - To modify, delete, react or reply to a comment, move to the window containing the thread buffer
  - Perform any operations as if you were in a regular issue buffer
- Review pending comments with `Octo review comments`
  - Use <CR> to jump to the selected pending comment
- If you want to review a specific commit, use `Octo review commit` to pick a commit. The file panel will get filtered to show only files changed by that commit. Any comments placed on these files will be applied at that specific commit level and will be added to the pending review.
- When ready, submit the review with `Octo review submit`
- A new float window will pop up. Enter the top level review comment and exit to normal mode. Then press `<C-m>` to submit a comment, `<C-a>` to approve it or `<C-r>` to request changes
